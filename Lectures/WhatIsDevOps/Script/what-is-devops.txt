Before we get started with our

Introduction to DevOps,

it's important to define

what we mean by DevOps and

how it compares to

what other people may mean

when they use the term DevOps.

A general definition of DevOps could be:

"DevOps is an approach to developing and delivering software

that utilizes a set of procedures and tools

to facilitate the collaboration between

developers and operations, with the goals of:

reducing manual interaction

in the process of building and delivering software,

increasing the quality of the software,

improving monitoring of key performance indicators

and encouraging cross-functional buy-in and investment

in product creation from conception through deployment."

The exact definition is not what's most important.

The most important things to keep in mind are:

DevOps is not just a philosophy.

DevOps is not just a set of tools.

DevOps is a combination of a philosopy with

a set of tools.

The combination of philosophy and tools

works to promote a cultural mindset.

In this course, we will be focusing on

giving you a conceptual understanding of 

the tools and the terminology related to DevOps.

We will not be focusing on the philosophical or cultural apsects,

nor will we be training you on the detailed use of the tools.

To begin our exploration, let me first talk about when DevOps

first came about.
