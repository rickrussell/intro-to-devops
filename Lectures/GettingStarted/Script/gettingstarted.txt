I hope that we have done a good job of

introducing you to DevOps and its benefits

and that you have decided that

you do wish to implement DevOps

within your organization.

Let me give you some suggestions on

how you can get started.

Since the key factor in ensuring

that DevOps will succeed in your organization

is creating the proper culture,

I suggest that you first obtain

buy-in from the people within your organization.

Sit down and make sure that you

are using a common vocabulary and

that you all mean the same thing

when you use a given word

in that vocabulary.

Get right into the Sharing aspect

by having everybody share their

thoughts, including any concerns

that they have.

Hold off on getting into the tools

and the processes until after

you are entirely sure that everybody

is on board.

Once you are sure that everybody is on board

then choose a short project on which

you'd like to begin to build

your DevOps mastery.

You want to be able to include

all of the DevOps practices.

The project should be short enough

that you can complete it

without having to risk too much time or money

and long enough that you have

the chance to complete some meaningful iterations.

You want to be able to complete at least

three or four demonstrations during

the course of the project,

including the delivery

of a "final" product.

The demonstrations give you deadlines

to release new features.

Ideally, you should complete a demonstration every week.

Having to demo every week

forces you to practice the "continuous"

aspects of DevOps.

The demonstrations also give you

the opportunity to collect feedback

and then make any necessary changes

as a result of that feedback.

Choose whatever languages and tools

are best suited to the project you have selected,

even if they are different from what you have been using.

Ignore "scale" issues.

Use source control.

Maintain a bug database.

Follow a single, consistent workflow.

Make sure that at least two people

look at everything.

Recognize that this process

is about practicing building

a new culture and skill set.

While it's great if you are able

to end this first exploration

with a useable final product,

it's not a failure if you don't.

The main point of this exploration

is for your organization to

learn how to do DevOps.

The experience should be

both educational and energizing.

You will be learning a lot of new things

and you should expect that you are

going to make mistakes.

Failure is something that

you can embrace when you start

to implement DevOps.

As you improve your DevOps process

you will find that you become

better at quickly responding to failures.

You will learn that the whole approach

is designed to make it safe

to make mistakes.

Once you have finished

this first exploration

hold a post-mortem and debriefing

to allow everybody to share

their lessons learned and to

give feedback on how to best move forward.

Please share your experiences

by posting to the Discussion board.

We'd love the opportunity

to learn from you!

Thanks for taking this class!
