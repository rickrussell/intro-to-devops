Welcome to "Introduction to DevOps"!

Akshat and I are honored to

have you as a student.

We've broken the course into sections

to help organize the material.

The course is mainly conceptual in nature

but we still cover certain details.

We progress from building your understanding

of the history of DevOps and

the terminology used in DevOps

to the tools used in DevOps.

Then we continue with an explanation of

how you can benefit from adopting

a DevOps culture and approach.

We conclude with some ideas of

how you can get started with DevOps.

We have included an exercise or quiz

in each section and it's important

for you to complete these.

They are designed to ensure that

you are grasping the key points.

Before we get started with the actual material

we'd like to introduce ourselves.
