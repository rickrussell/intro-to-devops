Hey there! I am Akshat Goel.

I am from India and is really excited to join Marc 

in creating this great learning experience for you.

A little about myself. I have been working as software developer since 6 years.

I started my career from small freelance projects to being a developer for one of the most used

desktop product in the world, Acrobat Reader. 

With this course, I hope to share with you lessons I learned on my way to managing large code bases and teams.

In my free time, I like to travel to Himalayas or read about others' journeys. So, if you have any questions for your next adventure to the mighty mountains, you know where to find me.

I am thrilled to get started with the course. So, let's get rolling!
