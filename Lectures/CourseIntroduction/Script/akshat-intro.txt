Hi! I am Akshat Goel.

I am from India and is really excited to join Marc 

in creating this great learning experience for you.

I have been working as software developer since 6 years.

Starting from small freelance projects to being contributor for one of the most used

product in the world, Acrobat Reader. 

So, anytime you see that balloon pop up for upgrading your Reader version, you know who to blame.

I have worked on small scripts to automate my dull daily tasks to creating apps used by million of users.

With this course, I hope to share with you lessons I learned on my way to managing large code bases and teams.

I am thrilled to get started with the course. So, let's get rolling!
