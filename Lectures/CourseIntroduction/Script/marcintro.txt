Hi, I'm Marc Isaacson.

I'm really glad to be co-teaching

this course with Akshat.

I began my programming career in 1989.

I worked on an IBM AS/400 writing

code in RPG.

There was no concept of version control

or a local development environment.

There truly was no collaboration between

developers and the operations people.

I don't believe we used

any automation tools, either.

In 2001 I pursued other interests,

returning to programming in 2010.

As I learned web development

I became exposed to things like

local development environments,

version control, patches

and commits.

However, I'm far from an expert

in DevOps.

I'll be learning new things

as I collaborate on teaching this course.

I'm excited to build my DevOps knowledge

and hope that you are too!
